Give events and genres from the following plot description in rdf format and annotate with YAGO with prefixes rdf, rdfs, ex, yago (event labels should not contain any character names):

Set against a backdrop of World War I, the Russian Revolution of 1917, and the Russian Civil War, the film uses a narrative framing device set in the late 1940s or early 1950s, involving NKVD Lieutenant General Yevgraf Zhivago, who is searching for the daughter of his half-brother, Dr Yuri Zhivago, and Larissa ("Lara") Antipova. Yevgraf believes a young woman, Tanya Komarova, may be his niece and tells her about Yuri's life.

After his mother's burial in rural Russia, the orphaned child Yuri was taken by family friends Alexander and Anna Gromeko to Moscow. In 1913, Zhivago, now a doctor and a poet, is reunited with the Gromekos' daughter, Tonya, when she returns after her schooling in Paris. They become engaged.

Lara, then only 17 years old, is seduced by her mother's much older friend/lover, the well-connected Victor Komarovsky. Lara's friend, the idealistic reformer Pasha Antipov, is wounded by sabre-wielding mounted police when they attack a peaceful demonstration. Pasha's wound is treated by Lara, whom he wishes to marry. She hides a gun he picked up at the demonstration. 

After learning of her daughter's relationship with Komarovsky, Lara's mother attempts suicide. Komarovsky summons a doctor friend, who brings along Zhivago as his asssitant. Komarovsky attempts to dissuade Lara from marrying Pasha. When she refuses, he pressures her into sex. Lara later takes Pasha's gun and follows Komarovsky to a party. She shoots him, only wounding his arm. Komarovsky insists no action be taken against Lara, and she is escorted out by Pasha, who followed her. Meanwhile, Zhivago, who is another guest, treats Komarovsky's wound. Although devastated by Lara's admission about Komarovsky, Pasha marries her, and they move away, eventually having a daughter, Katya.

During World War I, Yevgraf Zhivago is sent by the Bolsheviks to subvert the army. Yuri, now married to Tonya, becomes a battlefield doctor. Pasha, dissatisfied in his marriage to Lara, joins up, but is reported missing in action. Lara enlists as a nurse to search for him. Yuri encounters Lara. For the next six months, they serve at a field hospital, during which time radical changes ensue in Russia as Vladimir Lenin returns from exile. Before their departure from the hospital, Zhivago and Lara fall in love, though Zhivago remains faithful to Tonya.

After the war, Yuri returns to Tonya, their son Alexander (Sasha), and the now-widowed Alexander Gromeko. Their Moscow house has been confiscated by the new Soviet government and they share it with many others. Yevgraf, now in the Cheka, informs Yuri that his poems have been condemned as antagonistic to communism. Fearing Zhivago will incriminate himself through his poetry, Yevgraf provides documents for the family to travel to the Gromekos' country home, "Varykino", located in the Ural Mountains. The family boards a heavily guarded train, travelling through contested territory where the Bolshevik commander, Strelnikov, formerly Pasha Antipov, is fighting. 

While the train makes a mid-journey stop, Yuri gets out, wandering too close to Strelnikov's armoured train on a nearby track. He is captured and taken to Strelnikov. During the interrogation, Yuri recognizes Strelnikov as Pasha. Strelnikov mentions that Lara is living in Yuriatin, where Yuri is headed and which is occupied by the anti-Communist White forces. Strelnikov deems Yuri a non-threat and allows him to return to his train. Finding the main house on the Varykino estate seized and sealed up by the Bolsheviks, the family settle into a cottage next door. While in Yuriatin, Yuri sees Lara, and they begin an affair. Tonya is pregnant again and when she is about to give birth, Yuri travels to Yuriatin to break off with Lara. On his return, he is abducted by Communist partisans and forced to join their medical service.

After two years, Yuri deserts. Amid great hardship, he returns to Yuriatin and Lara, arriving ill and suffering from frostbite. Lara says that Tonya contacted her while searching for Yuri. Leaving his belongings with Lara, she returned to Moscow. She later sent Lara a sealed letter to give Yuri if he returned. The letter is six months old. Tonya had given birth to a daughter named Anna, and she, her father, and her two children were deported and are living in Paris.

Yuri and Lara become lovers again. One night Komarovsky arrives and warns that Cheka agents have been watching them due to Lara's marriage to Strelnikov. Komarovsky offers them help to leave Russia, but they refuse. Yuri and Lara return to the abandoned Varykino estate, and hide in the main house. Yuri begins the "Lara" poems, which will later bring him popular fame but government disapproval. Komarovsky arrives with a small party of troops. Recently appointed as a regional official in the Far Eastern Republic, he informs Yuri that the Cheka only allowed Lara to remain in the area to lure Strelnikov; he had been captured five miles away, and committed suicide en route to his execution. They now intend to arrest Lara. Yuri accepts Komarovsky's offer of safe passage for himself, Lara, and her daughter. Once Lara is on her way, Yuri stays behind, instead of following. On the train, Lara tells Komarovsky that she is pregnant with Yuri's child.

Years later in Moscow, Yevgraf procures a medical job for his frail half-brother. While looking out of a tram window, Yuri sees Lara in the street. He runs after her but suffers a fatal heart attack before reaching her. Yuri's funeral is well-attended, despite his poetry being banned. Lara approaches Yevgraf and asks for his help to find her daughter by Yuri, who was lost during the civil war. Yevgraf helps her search the orphanages, but they are unable to locate her. Lara disappears and Yevgraf believes she must have died in one of the labour camps.

While Yevgraf believes that Tanya Komarova is Yuri and Lara's daughter, she remains unconvinced. After persistently being asked how she came to be lost, Tanya finally answers that her "father" had let go of her hand when they were running from the war's chaos. Yevgraf responds that a real father would not have let go. Tanya promises to consider what Yevgraf has told her.
