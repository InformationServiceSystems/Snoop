Give events and genres from the following plot description in rdf format and annotate with YAGO with prefixes rdf, rdfs, ex, yago, and make sure the event labels are more general and do not contain character names:

Elisa Esposito, who was found abandoned by the side of a river as an infant with wounds on her neck, is mute and communicates through sign language. In 1962, during the Cold War, Elisa works as a custodian at a secret government laboratory in Baltimore, Maryland, and lives a very routine life in an apartment above a movie theater. Her only friends are her closeted gay next-door neighbor Giles, a struggling middle-aged advertising illustrator, and her co-worker Zelda Fuller.

Colonel Richard Strickland has just captured a mysterious creature from a South American river and has taken the creature to the Baltimore facility for further study. Curious about the creature, Elisa discovers it is a humanoid amphibian. She begins visiting him in secret, and the two form a close bond.

Seeking to exploit the Amphibian Man for a US advantage in the Space Race, General Frank Hoyt is eventually persuaded by Strickland to vivisect it. Dr. Robert Hoffstetler, a scientist who is secretly a Russian spy named Dimitri Mosenkov, pleads unsuccessfully to Strickland to keep the Amphibian Man alive for further study, while simultaneously ordered by his Soviet handlers to "euthanize" (murder) the creature.

When Elisa overhears the Americans' plans for the Amphibian Man, she attempts to persuade Giles to help her liberate him. Giles refuses at first, scared of the consequences and ethics. After failing to get his job back; Giles is rejected by a pie restaurant worker, who he discovers is a racist and homophobe; subsequently, Giles has a change of heart. Hoffstetler stumbles upon Elisa's plot in progress and chooses to assist her. Though initially reluctant, Zelda also becomes involved in making the escape successful.

Elisa plans to release the Amphibian Man into a nearby canal when heavy rain will allow access to the ocean. In the meantime, she keeps him in her bathtub. Strickland interrogates Elisa and Zelda, among others, but he learns nothing.

The Amphibian Man, curious about Giles's cats, is met with a hostile attitude from the cat. Giles discovers the Amphibian Man devouring the cat. When he tries to stop him, the Amphibian Man gets startled, slashes Giles's arm and rushes out of the apartment. He gets as far as the cinema downstairs before Elisa finds him and returns him to her apartment. The creature touches Giles on his balding head and wounded arm; and the next morning, Giles discovers hair has begun growing back on his previously bald head, while the wounds on his arm have healed. Elisa continues to develop her romantic relationship with the Amphibian Man, culminating in sexual intercourse.

General Hoyt unexpectedly arrives and tells Strickland he has 36 hours to recover the Amphibian Man, or his career and life will be over. Meanwhile, Hoffstetler is told by his handlers that he will be extracted from the US in two days. Although the planned release date approaches, the Amphibian Man's health begins to deteriorate.

Hoffstetler goes to meet his handlers, and Strickland follows him. At the rendezvous, Hoffstetler is shot by one of his handlers, but Strickland, in turn, shoots and euthanizes both handlers. Having realized that Hoffstetler is a spy, Strickland tortures the dying Hoffstetler into revealing specifics on the "team" which "extracted" the Amphibian Man, and Strickland is surprised to learn that Elisa and Zelda are implicated.

Strickland threatens Zelda in her home, unsuccessfully, until her husband, Brewster, reveals that Elisa has the Amphibian Man. Zelda immediately telephones Elisa, warning her to release the creature. An enraged Strickland ransacks Elisa's empty apartment until he finds the bathtub full of chemicals and a calendar note revealing where she plans to release the Amphibian Man.

At the canal, Elisa and Giles are bidding farewell to the creature when Strickland arrives, knocks Giles down, and shoots both the Amphibian Man and Elisa. The Amphibian Man quickly applies his healing abilities himself, and slashes Strickland's throat, killing him. As the police arrive on the scene with Zelda, the Amphibian Man takes Elisa and jumps into the canal where he swims around her, not knowing she is dead. When he applies his healing ability underwater to the scars on Elisa's neck, they open to reveal gills like his. She jolts back to life and the two embrace and kiss. In a closing voice-over narration, Giles conveys his belief that Elisa lived "happily ever after" and "remained in love" with the Amphibian Man.
