A middle-aged woman encounters a mysterious box with ominous Hebrew writing, leading to a violent and inexplicable attack. Later, a divorced couple's daughter, Em, discovers the same box and becomes increasingly disturbed as she becomes possessed by a malevolent force. With the help of a rabbi, her family attempts an exorcism to rid Em of the entity, leading to a climactic struggle and ultimately trapping the spirit back inside the box, but the box continues to whisper ominously.
