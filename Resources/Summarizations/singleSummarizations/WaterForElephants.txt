Charlie O'Brien, a circus owner, meets Jacob Jankowski, an elderly man who shares his past as a circus worker. Jacob recounts his story as a young veterinary student during the Great Depression, who joins the Benzini Bros. circus and becomes involved in the complex dynamics between the ringmaster, August, his wife Marlena, and the mistreated elephant, Rosie. As Jacob and Marlena's love grows, they face abuse and danger from August, leading to a climactic event where they fight back, rescue Rosie, and ultimately find happiness together before Jacob's present-day return to the circus.
