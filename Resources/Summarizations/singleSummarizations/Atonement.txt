In 1935 England, Briony Tallis misinterprets a heated encounter between her sister Cecilia and Robbie Turner, mistakenly believing Robbie is a threat. Briony's false accusation leads to Robbie's arrest, and he is later sent to fight in World War II. Years later, as an elderly and remorseful novelist, Briony reveals the tragic truth that she fabricated a happy ending for Cecilia and Robbie in her book "Atonement," in an attempt to atone for her mistake. In reality, Robbie died in the war, and Cecilia drowned during the Blitz, leaving Briony burdened with guilt and unable to truly mend what she had broken.
