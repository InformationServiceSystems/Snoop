'The research article "Multiple renal cancer susceptibility polymorphisms modulate the HIF pathway" explores the relationship between genetic variations and the development of renal cancer. The study focuses on specific polymorphisms, or genetic variations, that affect the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway, which plays a critical role in tumor growth and progression. The researchers investigate how these genetic variations influence HIF pathway activity and their association with renal cancer susceptibility. The findings suggest that certain polymorphisms can modulate the HIF pathway, potentially increasing the risk of renal cancer. This study enhances our understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying renal cancer and highlights the importance of the HIF pathway in its development.',
    ' The research paper "A genetic polymorphism affects the risk and prognosis of renal cell carcinoma: association with follistatin-like protein 1 expression" investigates a specific genetic variation and its impact on the development and prognosis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), a type of kidney cancer. The study focuses on a polymorphism in a gene associated with follistatin-like protein 1 (FSTL1) expression. The researchers conducted a case-control study involving individuals with RCC and healthy controls to analyze the frequency of the genetic variant in both groups. They found a significant association between the genetic polymorphism and the risk of developing RCC. Individuals with the variant were more likely to develop RCC compared to those without the variant. Furthermore, the study investigated the influence of the genetic variant on the prognosis of RCC patients. The researchers analyzed the expression levels of FSTL1 in tumor tissues from RCC patients with and without the genetic polymorphism. They discovered that patients carrying the variant had lower expression levels of FSTL1, which was associated with poorer prognosis and shorter overall survival. Overall, the research paper highlights the impact of a specific genetic polymorphism on the risk of RCC development and its influence on the prognosis of patients, possibly through its association with FSTL1 expression.',
    'The research article "Variants of SCARB1 and VDR Involved in Complex Genetic Interactions May Be Implicated in the Genetic Susceptibility to Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma" explores the potential genetic susceptibility factors for clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), a common type of kidney cancer. The study focuses on two genes, SCARB1 and VDR, and their variants that may interact in complex ways to contribute to the risk of ccRCC. To investigate this, the researchers conducted a case-control study involving individuals with ccRCC and healthy controls. They analyzed the frequencies of different genetic variants within SCARB1 and VDR in both groups. The study revealed that specific variants of these genes were associated with an increased risk of developing ccRCC. Additionally, the researchers examined the interactions between the variants of SCARB1 and VDR. They found that certain combinations of variants in these genes showed a synergistic effect, meaning that the combined presence of these variants further increased the risk of ccRCC compared to having either variant alone. The findings suggest that the genetic susceptibility to ccRCC may involve complex interactions between variants of SCARB1 and VDR. These genetic interactions could play a role in the development of ccRCC and contribute to the overall genetic risk for this type of kidney cancer.',
    'The research article "Germline genetic variations at 11q13 and 12p11 locus modulate age at onset for renal cell carcinoma" investigates the influence of genetic variations on the age at onset of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The study focuses on two specific genetic loci, 11q13 and 12p11, and their potential impact on the development of RCC. The researchers conducted a comprehensive analysis of the germline genetic variations in a large cohort of individuals with RCC. They discovered that specific variations at the 11q13 and 12p11 loci were associated with variations in the age at onset of RCC. These genetic variations were found to be more prevalent in individuals who developed RCC at a younger age. The study findings suggest that these particular genetic variations contribute to the modulation of the age at which RCC manifests. The identification of these loci provides valuable insights into the genetic factors influencing RCC development and may have implications for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of this type of cancer.',
    'The research paper titled "A genome-wide association study of renal cell carcinoma among African Americans" focuses on investigating the genetic factors associated with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) specifically among individuals of African American descent. RCC is a type of kidney cancer that is known to have different incidence rates and clinical features among various ethnic groups. The study employs a genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach, which involves analyzing a large number of genetic markers across the entire genome of African American individuals with RCC. The researchers collected and analyzed genetic data from a significant number of RCC cases and control individuals from African American populations. The results of the study identified several genetic variants that showed significant associations with RCC among African Americans. These variants were located in regions of the genome that are known to play a role in cancer development and progression. Additionally, the study found that some of these genetic variants were unique to African American populations, suggesting potential genetic differences in RCC susceptibility compared to other ethnic groups. The findings of this research paper contribute to the understanding of the genetic basis of RCC among African Americans. Identifying these genetic variants can help in early detection, risk assessment, and development of targeted therapies for RCC patients of African American descent. Further research is needed to validate and expand upon these findings to gain a more comprehensive understanding of RCC genetics in diverse populations.',
    'The research article "Genetic variation in the GSTM3 promoter confers risk and prognosis of renal cell carcinoma by reducing gene expression" investigates the relationship between genetic variations in the GSTM3 gene promoter and the development and prognosis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The study suggests that specific variations in the GSTM3 gene promoter region are associated with an increased risk of developing RCC and poorer prognosis. These variations lead to a decrease in GSTM3 gene expression, which may contribute to the progression and aggressiveness of RCC. The findings highlight the potential role of GSTM3 promoter variations as genetic markers for assessing RCC risk and prognosis.',
    'The research article titled "A genome-wide association study identifies a novel susceptibility locus for renal cell carcinoma on 12p11.23" describes a study that aimed to identify genetic factors associated with renal cell carcinoma (RCC), a type of kidney cancer. The researchers conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) involving a large number of individuals with RCC and healthy controls. The study identified a specific region on chromosome 12p11.23 that showed a significant association with RCC susceptibility. This region represents a novel susceptibility locus, meaning it has not been previously linked to RCC risk. The researchers found that genetic variations in this region were more prevalent in individuals with RCC compared to the control group. The studys findings suggest that genetic factors in the 12p11.23 region may play a role in the development of RCC. Further research is needed to understand the specific genes or mechanisms involved in this association and how they contribute to the development of RCC. These findings contribute to our understanding of the genetic basis of RCC and may have implications for future diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.',
    'The article Chromosome 11q13.3 variant modifies renal cell cancer risk in a Chinese population investigates the relationship between a specific genetic variant on chromosome 11q13.3 and the risk of developing renal cell cancer (RCC) in a Chinese population. The researchers conducted a case-control study involving a large number of RCC patients and healthy individuals. They analyzed the genetic profiles of the participants and found that the variant on chromosome 11q13.3 was significantly associated with an increased risk of RCC. Furthermore, the study revealed that this genetic variant interacted with certain environmental factors, such as smoking and obesity, amplifying the risk of RCC development. These findings suggest that the chromosome 11q13.3 variant plays a role in modifying RCC susceptibility in the Chinese population and highlights the importance of gene-environment interactions in cancer risk.',
    ' The research article titled "Genome-wide association study of renal cell carcinoma identifies two susceptibility loci on 2p21 and 11q13.3" focuses on the identification of genetic factors associated with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The study conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and discovered two specific regions on the human genome, namely 2p21 and 11q13.3, that are associated with an increased risk of developing RCC. These findings provide valuable insights into the genetic basis of RCC and may contribute to improved understanding, early detection, and potential treatment strategies for this type of kidney cancer.',
    'The research article "Fine mapping of a region of chromosome 11q13 reveals multiple independent loci associated with risk of prostate cancer" focuses on studying the genetic factors influencing prostate cancer risk. The researchers conducted a detailed analysis of a specific region on chromosome 11q13 and identified multiple distinct genetic loci associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer. The findings suggest that different genetic variations within this region independently contribute to prostate cancer susceptibility. This study provides valuable insights into the genetic basis of prostate cancer and highlights the complexity of its genetic architecture.',
'Un-physiological activation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) is an early event in most renal cell cancers (RCC) following inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor. Despite intense study, how this impinges on cancer development is incompletely understood. To test for the impact of genetic signals on this pathway, we aligned human RCC-susceptibility polymorphisms with genome-wide assays of HIF-binding and observed highly significant overlap. Allele-specific assays of HIF binding, chromatin conformation and gene expression together with eQTL analyses in human tumors were applied to mechanistic analysis of one such overlapping site at chromosome 12p12.1. This defined a novel stage-specific mechanism in which the risk polymorphism, rs12814794, directly creates a new HIF-binding site that mediates HIF-1α isoform specific upregulation of its target BHLHE41. The alignment of multiple sites in the HIF cis-acting apparatus with RCC-susceptibility polymorphisms strongly supports a causal model in which minor variation in this pathway exerts significant effects on RCC development.',
'Few single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the risk of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have been identified, yet genetic predisposition contributes significantly to this malignancy. We previously showed that follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1) was significantly down-regulated in clear cell RCC (ccRCC), in particular metastatic ccRCC. In the present study, we systemically investigated the associations of the 6 SNPs within FSTL1-coding genomic region with RCC risk and postoperative prognosis. Age- and gender-matched case-control study (417 vs 855) indicated that rs1259293 variant genotype CC was significantly associated with an increased risk of RCC, with an odds ratio of 2.004 (95% confidence internal [CI] = 1.190-3.375). Multivariate Cox regression analysis in 309 of 417 cases showed that rs1259293 genotype (CC vs TT + CT) independently predicted an unfavorable prognosis, with a hazard ratio of 2.531 (95% CI = 1.052-6.086). Expression of FSTL1 was significantly higher in adjacent renal tissues than in tumors, and significantly higher in the tissues with rs1259293 TT genotype than in those with rs1259293 TC+CC genotypes. rs1259293 C allele might generate a CTCF binding site that blocks trans-activation of FSTL1 expression. Our results indicate that rs1259293 is associated with an increased risk and unfavorable postoperative prognosis of RCC, possibly by down-regulating FSTL1 expression in renal tissues.',
'The current data are still inconclusive in terms of a genetic component involved in the susceptibility to renal cell carcinoma. Our aim was to evaluate 40 selected candidate polymorphisms for potential association with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) based on independent group of 167 patients and 200 healthy controls. The obtained data were searched for independent effects of particular polymorphisms as well as haplotypes and genetic interactions. Association testing implied position rs4765623 in the SCARB1 gene (OR = 1.688, 95% CI: 1.104-2.582, P = 0.016) and a haplotype in VDR comprising positions rs739837, rs731236, rs7975232, and rs1544410 (P = 0.012) to be the risk factors in the studied population. The study detected several epistatic effects contributing to the genetic susceptibility to ccRCC. Variation in GNAS1 was implicated in a strong synergistic interaction with BIRC5. This effect was part of a model suggested by multifactor dimensionality reduction method including also a synergy between GNAS1 and SCARB1 (P = 0.036). Significance of GNAS1-SCARB1 interaction was further confirmed by logistic regression (P = 0.041), which also indicated involvement of SCARB1 in additional interaction with EPAS1 (P = 0.008) as well as revealing interactions between GNAS1 and EPAS1 (P = 0.016), GNAS1 and MC1R (P = 0.031), GNAS1 and VDR (P = 0.032), and MC1R and VDR (P = 0.035).',
'Purpose: Few risk factors have been identified for renal cell carcinoma. We performed a validation study in a population with a European background to identify the most significant variants previously identified in association with renal cell carcinoma risk. Materials and methods: We performed a case-control validation study after recruiting 463 controls and 463 patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma. For each patient and matched control we genotyped 8 single nucleotide polymorphisms selected from previous studies to evaluate the association between candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms and renal cell carcinoma susceptibility. Results: After adjusting for patient age, gender, smoking status and body mass index the AG + AA genotypes from rs7105934 (11q13) were associated with a decreased risk of renal cell carcinoma (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.33-0.75, p = 0.001) and the AC + CC genotypes from rs1049380 (ITPR2) were associated with an increased risk (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.28-2.16, p <0.001). Kidney cancer developed at an older age in patients carrying the dominant risk allele A for rs7105934 (mean age at diagnosis 73.1 vs 68.9 years, p = 0.002) and at a younger age in those carrying the dominant allele C for rs1049380 (mean 68.1 vs 70.8 years, p = 0.005). Conclusions: In what is to our knowledge the first validation study of the main 8 single nucleotide polymorphism variants associated with renal cell carcinoma susceptibility we confirmed the association of 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms with the risk of renal cell carcinoma. Each variant influenced patient age at disease diagnosis.',
'Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in populations of European ancestry have identified four susceptibility loci. No GWAS has been conducted among African Americans (AA), who experience a higher incidence of RCC. We conducted a GWAS in which we analyzed 1,136,723 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) among 255 cases and 375 controls of African ancestry, and further investigated 16 SNPs in a replication set (140 cases and 543 controls). The 12p11.23 variant rs10771279, located 77 kb from the European-ancestry RCC marker rs718314, was associated with RCC risk in the GWAS (P = 1.2 × 10(-7)) but did not replicate (P = 0.99). Consistent with European-ancestry findings, the A allele of rs7105934 on 11q13.3 was associated with decreased risk [OR, 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.64-0.91; P = 0.0022]. The frequency of this allele was higher than that observed in the European-ancestry GWAS (0.56 and 0.07, respectively, among controls). The rs7105934 association was stronger for clear cell RCC (ccRCC: OR, 0.56; P = 7.4 × 10(-7)) and absent for cases of other or unknown histology (OR, 1.02; P = 0.86). Analyses of rs7105934 by subtype among European-ancestry participants from these studies yielded similar findings (ORs 0.69 and 0.92, respectively). This study provides, to our knowledge, the first evidence that rs7105934 is an RCC susceptibility locus among AAs. Our finding that the association with this SNP may be specific to clear-cell RCC is novel and requires additional investigation. Additional investigation of rs10771279 and other suggestive GWAS findings is also needed.',
'Background: Glutathione S-transferase mu 3 (GSTM3) has been proven to be downregulated in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We aimed to characterise the role of GSTM3 and its genetic predisposition on the occurrence and postoperative prognosis of RCC. Methods: The effect of GSTM3 on RCC aggressiveness was examined using transfection and silencing methods. Glutathione S-transferase mu 3 expression in renal tissues was examined by immunohistochemistry. The associations of rs1332018 (A-63C) and rs7483 (V224I) polymorphisms with RCC risk were examined using 400 RCC patients and 802 healthy controls. The factors contributing to postoperative disease-specific survival of RCC patients were evaluated using the Cox proportional hazard model. Results: Glutathione S-transferase mu 3 silencing increased the invasion and anchorage-independent growth of RCC cell lines. rs1332018 (AC+CC vs AA), which correlated with low expression of GSTM3 in kidney, was associated with RCC risk (odds ratio, 1.446; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.111-1.882). rs1332018 variants and low GSTM3 expression significantly predicted unfavourable postoperative survivals of RCC patients (P<0.05). rs1332018 variants independently predicted a poor prognosis (hazard ratio, 2.119; 95% CI, 1.043-4.307). Conclusion: Glutathione S-transferase mu 3 may function as a tumour suppressor in RCC. rs1332018 genetic variants predispose the host to downregulating GSTM3 expression in kidney, facilitate carcinogenesis, and predict an unfavourable postoperative prognosis of RCC.',
'Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most lethal urologic cancer. Only two common susceptibility loci for RCC have been confirmed to date. To identify additional RCC common susceptibility loci, we conducted an independent genome-wide association study (GWAS). We analyzed 533 191 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for association with RCC in 894 cases and 1516 controls of European descent recruited from MD Anderson Cancer Center in the primary scan, and validated the top 500 SNPs in silico in 3772 cases and 8505 controls of European descent involved in the only published GWAS of RCC. We identified two common variants in linkage disequilibrium, rs718314 and rs1049380 (r(2) = 0.64, D = 0.84), in the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor, type 2 (ITPR2) gene on 12p11.23 as novel susceptibility loci for RCC (P = 8.89 × 10(-10) and P = 6.07 × 10(-9), respectively, in meta-analysis) with an allelic odds ratio of 1.19 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13-1.26] for rs718314 and 1.18 (95% CI: 1.12-1.25) for rs1049380. It has been recently identified that rs718314 in ITPR2 is associated with waist-hip ratio (WHR) phenotype. To our knowledge, this is the first genetic locus associated with both cancer risk and WHR.',
'A recent genome-wide association study of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in European population has identified genetic variants in the regions of 2p21 (rs7579899), 11q13.3 (rs7105934) and 12q24.31 (rs4765623) conferred susceptibility to RCC. In our study, we assessed whether these polymorphisms are also associated with RCC risk in a Chinese population. We genotyped these polymorphisms using TaqMan method and assessed their associations with RCC risk in a case-control study of 710 patients with histologically confirmed RCC and 760 cancer-free controls. Normal renal tissues adjacent to tumors were used to evaluate the functional consequences of these polymorphisms. We found that rs7105934 was significantly associated with reduced RCC risk [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.67, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) = 0.47-0.95, GA+AA versus GG], particularly among subgroups of normal-weight individuals (OR = 0.51, 95%CI = 0.29-0.88), never-smokers (OR = 0.53, 95%CI = 0.33-0.85) and non-drinkers (OR = 0.57, 95%CI = 0.370.87). Furthermore, the rs7105934 GA genotype was associated with lower levels of CCND1 mRNA compared with GG genotype, although this association was only marginally significant (P = 0.055). No significant association between rs7579899 or rs7105934 and RCC risk was observed. Our results suggest that rs7105934 on 11q13.3 may confer susceptibility to RCC in our population. Large population-based prospective and functional studies are required to validate the associations between these loci and RCC risk.',
'We conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in 3,772 affected individuals (cases) and 8,505 controls of European background from 11 studies and followed up 6 SNPs in 3 replication studies of 2,198 cases and 4,918 controls. Two loci on the regions of 2p21 and 11q13.3 were associated with RCC susceptibility below genome-wide significance. Two correlated variants (r² = 0.99 in controls), rs11894252 (P = 1.8 × 10⁻⁸) and rs7579899 (P = 2.3 × 10⁻⁹), map to EPAS1 on 2p21, which encodes hypoxia-inducible-factor-2 alpha, a transcription factor previously implicated in RCC. The second locus, rs7105934, at 11q13.3, contains no characterized genes (P = 7.8 × 10⁻¹⁴). In addition, we observed a promising association on 12q24.31 for rs4765623, which maps to SCARB1, the scavenger receptor class B, member 1 gene (P = 2.6 × 10⁻⁸). Our study reports previously unidentified genomic regions associated with RCC risk that may lead to new etiological insights.',
'Genome-wide association studies have identified prostate cancer susceptibility alleles on chromosome 11q13. As part of the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) Initiative, the region flanking the most significant marker, rs10896449, was fine mapped in 10 272 cases and 9123 controls of European origin (10 studies) using 120 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected by a two-staged tagging strategy using HapMap SNPs. Single-locus analysis identified 18 SNPs below genome-wide significance (P< 10(-8)) with rs10896449 the most significant (P= 7.94 × 10(-19)). Multi-locus models that included significant SNPs sequentially identified a second association at rs12793759 [odds ratio (OR) = 1.14, P= 4.76 × 10(-5), adjusted P= 0.004] that is independent of rs10896449 and remained significant after adjustment for multiple testing within the region. rs10896438, a proxy of previously reported rs12418451 (r(2)= 0.96), independent of both rs10896449 and rs12793759 was detected (OR = 1.07, P= 5.92 × 10(-3), adjusted P= 0.054). Our observation of a recombination hotspot that separates rs10896438 from rs10896449 and rs12793759, and low linkage disequilibrium (rs10896449-rs12793759, r(2)= 0.17; rs10896449-rs10896438, r(2)= 0.10; rs12793759-rs10896438, r(2)= 0.12) corroborate our finding of three independent signals. By analysis of tagged SNPs across ∼123 kb using next generation sequencing of 63 controls of European origin, 1000 Genome and HapMap data, we observed multiple surrogates for the three independent signals marked by rs10896449 (n= 31), rs10896438 (n= 24) and rs12793759 (n= 8). Our results indicate that a complex architecture underlying the common variants contributing to prostate cancer risk at 11q13. We estimate that at least 63 common variants should be considered in future studies designed to investigate the biological basis of the multiple association signals.',
'Hitmen Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega arrive at an apartment to retrieve a briefcase for their boss, gangster Marsellus Wallace, from a business partner, Brett. After Vincent checks the contents of the briefcase, Jules shoots one of Bretts associates. He declaims a passage from the Bible, and he and Vincent kill Brett for trying to double-cross Marsellus. Another man bursts out of the bathroom and fires at them, but every shot misses; after briefly checking themselves for wounds, Jules and Vincent shoot him dead. While driving away with Bretts associate Marvin, Jules professes that their survival was a miracle, which Vincent disputes. Vincent accidentally shoots Marvin in the face, killing him, and covering Vincent, Jules, and the car interior in blood in broad daylight. They hide the car at the home of Juless friend Jimmie, who demands they deal with the problem before his wife, Bonnie, comes home.

'In his 2010, Yablo presents six problems for the ‘standard‘, static semantics given for epistemic possibility statements and thereby challenges their entitlement to the description ‗epistemic‘. I argue that, with some modification, a standard account like that of DeRose (1991) can withstand all of the objections he raises. Specifically I propose that DeRose abandon his commitment to ‘Moore‘s Principle‘, the postulation that speakers who utter ‘might‘ statements always participate in the relevant epistemic community. It has been said that without an account of how relevance in DeRose‘s account is to be constrained, it is too uninformative to provide an interesting analysis. I take a small step to answer this complaint by providing one such constraint. The resulting account provides an understanding of epistemic possibility statements in terms of shared knowledge, availability of relevant information and an epistemic community.',
'Imprecise probabilities offer a more psychologically reasonable account of belief than does the strict Bayesian framework. One major issue with imprecise models of belief is that decision making in this framework is a fraught affair. I pinpoint this problem and show that there is a strong sense in which it is unavoidable.',
'In this paper I will examine the accounts Frege gives of identity statements in ‘Begrisschrift’ and ‘Uber Sinn und Bedeutung. It is generally believed that Frege gives a metalinguistic account of 3 identity statements in Begrisschrift, and an object denotational account in ‘Uber Sinn und Bedeutung. However the accounts he provides and the rationale for them is very similar in both works. He certainly does not provide any refutation of the Begrisschrift account in Uber Sinn und Bedeutung. I will consider attempts at solving this puzzle provided Mike Thau & Ben Caplan, and Gilead Bar-Elli in my investigation, concluding that neither of them provide a satisfactory explanation of Freges intentions in each work. I will then offer my own explanation, drawing on Freges work between the two texts, and conclude that the traditional view of his identity statement accounts is correct, and that the mystery is easily defeated.',
'The debate between two-aspect and two-world interpretations of the relation – contained in the first Critique1 – between the appearances and things in themselves is one which has not yet been laid to rest. This is largely due, as many debates over the interpretation of the Critique are, to Kants complex and ambiguous formulations. It is my intention in this paper to examine a line of reasoning which lends itself to a clear sense in which the appearances and things in themselves cannot be identified. This line of reasoning does not settle the matter, but allows us to arrive at a more subtle formulation of the question. Towards the end of the paper, I briefly examine a couple of consequences of my discussion for Allison’s two-aspect view. This view can potentially benefit from my reformulation of the question. Finally, I gesture at a potential understanding of the relation between the appearances and things in themselves which lines up with the points raised over the course of the paper.',
'Organizations replace their legacy systems for technical, economic, and operational reasons. Replacement is a risky proposition, as high levels of technical and social inertia make these systems hard to withdraw. Failure to fully replace systems results in complex system architectures involving manifold hidden dependencies that carry technical debt. To understand how a process for replacing a complex legacy system unfolds and accumulates technical debt, we conducted an explanatory case study at a local manufacturing site that had struggled to replace its mission-critical legacy systems as part of the larger global company’s commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) system implementation. We approach the replacement as a sociotechnical change and leverage the punctuated sociotechnical information system change model in combination with the design-moves framework to analyze how the site balanced creating digital options, countering social inertia, and managing (architectural) technical debt. The findings generalize to a two-level (local/global) system-dynamics model delineating how replacing a deeply entrenched mission-critical system generates positive and negative feedback loops within and between social and technical changes at local and global levels. The loops, unless addressed, accrue technical debt that hinders legacy system discontinuance and gradually locks the organization into a debt-constrained state. The model helps managers anticipate challenges that accompany replacing highly entrenched systems and formulate effective strategies to address them.',
'Biases on online platforms pose a threat to social inclusion. We examine the influence of a novel source of bias in online philanthropic lending, namely that associated with religious differences. We first propose religion distance as a probabilistic measure of differences between pairs of individuals residing in different countries. We then incorporate this measure into a gravity model of trade to explain variation in country-to-country lending volumes. We further propose a set of contextual moderators that characterize individuals’ offline (local) and online social contexts, which we argue combine to determine the influence of religion distance on lending activity. We empirically estimate our gravity model using data from Kiva.org, reflecting all lending actions that took place between 2006 and 2017. We demonstrate the negative and significant effect of religion distance on lending activity, over and above other established factors in the literature. Further, we demonstrate the moderating role of lenders’ offline social context (diversity, social hostilities, and governmental favoritism of religion) on the aforementioned relationship to online lending behavior. Finally, we offer empirical evidence of the parallel role of online contextual factors, namely those related to community features offered by the Kiva platform (lending teams), which appear to amplify the role of religious bias. In particular, we show that religious team membership is a double-edged sword that has both favorable and unfavorable consequences, increasing lending in general but skewing said lending toward religiously similar borrowers. Our findings speak to the important frictions associated with religious differences in individual philanthropy; they point to the role of governmental policy vis-à-vis religious tolerance as a determinant of citizens’ global philanthropic behavior, and they highlight design implications for online platforms with an eye toward managing religious bias.',
'Unstructured multimedia data (text and audio) provides unprecedented opportunities to derive actionable decision-making in the financial industry, in areas such as portfolio and risk management. However, due to formidable methodological challenges, the promise of business value from unstructured multimedia data has not materialized. In this study, we use a design science approach to develop DeepVoice, a novel nonverbal predictive analysis system for financial risk prediction, in the setting of quarterly earnings conference calls. DeepVoice forecasts financial risk by leveraging not only what managers say (verbal linguistic cues) but also how managers say it (vocal cues) during the earnings conference calls. The design of DeepVoice addresses several challenges associated with the analysis of nonverbal communication. We also propose a two-stage deep learning model to effectively integrate managers’ sequential vocal and verbal cues. Using a unique dataset of 6,047 earnings call samples (audio recordings and textual transcripts) of S&P 500 firms across four years, we show that DeepVoice yields remarkably lower risk forecast errors than that achieved by previous efforts. The improvement can also translate into nontrivial economic gains in options trading. The theoretical and practical implications of analyzing vocal cues are discussed.',
'The growth of crowdfunding markets that include both expert and nonexpert investors will soon accelerate due to recent changes in Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations. Prior work has suggested that nonexperts (1) may benefit from experts’ participation via mimicking their trades, but (2) will also face a cost, as experts crowding nonexperts out of the best opportunities will ensure that nonexperts will suffer lower returns than experts. Traditional economic theory holds that the crowding effect means that the relative importance of nonexperts in the market will decline over time until they become unimportant. Exploiting a unique period in one crowdfunding market (Prosper.com) that allowed us to directly estimate the net cost of competing with better-informed experts, we found that the net negative effects of expert participation on nonexperts are small. We used simulations to both better understand (1) the market characteristics and crowdfunding platform choices that influence experts’ and nonexperts’ returns, their return gap, and the extent to which nonexperts are better or worse off relative to a market without expert participation, and (2) the factors that may contribute to the small expert/nonexpert Prosper return gap.',
'Emotion artificial intelligence, the algorithm that recognizes and interprets various human emotions beyond valence (positive and negative polarity), is still in its infancy but has attracted attention from industry and academia. Based on discrete emotion theory and statistical language modeling, this work proposes an algorithm to enable automatic domain-adaptive emotion lexicon construction and multidimensional emotion detection in texts. Using a large-scale dataset of China’s movie market from 2012 to 2018, we constructed and validated a domain-specific emotion lexicon and demonstrated the predictive power of eight discrete emotions (i.e., surprise, joy, anticipation, love, anxiety, sadness, anger, and disgust) in online reviews on box office sales. We found that representing overall emotions through discrete emotions yields higher prediction accuracy than valence or latent emotion variables generated by topic modeling. To understand the source of the predictive power from a theoretical perspective and to test the cross-culture generalizability of our prediction study, we further conducted an experiment in the U.S. movie market based on theories on emotion, judgment, and decision-making. We found that discrete emotions, mediated by perceived processing fluency, significantly affect the perceived review helpfulness, which further influences purchase intention. Our work shows the economic value of emotions in online reviews, generates insight into the mechanism of their effects, and has managerial implications for online review platform design, movie marketing, and cinema operations.',
'Stereo matching is one of the widely used techniques for inferring depth from stereo images owing to its robustness and speed. It has become one of the major topics of research since it finds its applications in autonomous driving, robotic navigation, 3D reconstruction, and many other fields. Finding pixel correspondences in non-textured, occluded and reflective areas is the major challenge in stereo matching. Recent developments have shown that semantic cues from image segmentation can be used to improve the results of stereo matching. Many deep neural network architectures have been proposed to leverage the advantages of semantic segmentation in stereo matching. This paper aims to give a comparison among the state of art networks both in terms of accuracy and in terms of speed which are of higher importance in real-time applications. The recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) combined with the extensive amount of data generated by todays clinical systems, has led to the development of imaging AI solutions across the whole value chain of medical imaging, including image reconstruction, medical image segmentation, image-based diagnosis and treatment planning. Notwithstanding the successes and future potential of AI in medical imaging, many stakeholders are concerned of the potential risks and ethical implications of imaging AI solutions, which are perceived as complex, opaque, and difficult to comprehend, utilise, and trust in critical clinical applications. Despite these concerns and risks, there are currently no concrete guidelines and best practices for guiding future AI developments in medical imaging towards increased trust, safety and adoption. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a careful selection of guiding principles drawn from the accumulated experiences, consensus, and best practices from five large European projects on AI in Health Imaging. These guiding principles are named FUTURE-AI and its building blocks consist of (i) Fairness, (ii) Universality, (iii) Traceability, (iv) Usability, (v) Robustness and (vi) Explainability. In a step-by-step approach, these guidelines are further translated into a framework of concrete recommendations for specifying, developing, evaluating, and deploying technically, clinically and ethically trustworthy AI solutions into clinical practice.',
'In this paper, we proposed a novel mutual consistency network (MC-Net+) toeffectively exploit the unlabeled hard regions for semi-supervised medicalimage segmentation. The MC-Net+ model is motivated by the observation that deepmodels trained with limited annotations are prone to output highly uncertainand easily mis-classified predictions in the ambiguous regions (e.g. adhesiveedges or thin branches) for the image segmentation task. Leveraging theseregion-level challenging samples can make the semi-supervised segmentationmodel training more effective. Therefore, our proposed MC-Net+ model consistsof two new designs. First, the model contains one shared encoder and multiplesightly different decoders (i.e. using different up-sampling strategies). Thestatistical discrepancy of multiple decoders outputs is computed to denote themodels uncertainty, which indicates the unlabeled hard regions. Second, a newmutual consistency constraint is enforced between one decoders probabilityoutput and other decoders soft pseudo labels. In this way, we minimize themodels uncertainty during training and force the model to generate invariantand low-entropy results in such challenging areas of unlabeled data, in orderto learn a generalized feature representation. We compared the segmentationresults of the MC-Net+ with five state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches onthree public medical datasets. Extension experiments with two commonsemi-supervised settings demonstrate the superior performance of our model overother existing methods, which sets a new state of the art for semi-supervisedmedical image segmentation.',
'Consistency training has proven to be an advanced semi-supervised frameworkand achieved promising results in medical image segmentation tasks throughenforcing an invariance of the predictions over different views of the inputs.However, with the iterative updating of model parameters, the models would tendto reach a coupled state and eventually lose the ability to exploit unlabeleddata. To address the issue, we present a novel semi-supervised segmentationmodel based on parameter decoupling strategy to encourage consistentpredictions from diverse views. Specifically, we first adopt a two-branchnetwork to simultaneously produce predictions for each image. During thetraining process, we decouple the two prediction branch parameters by quadraticcosine distance to construct different views in latent space. Based on this,the feature extractor is constrained to encourage the consistency ofprobability maps generated by classifiers under diversified features. In theoverall training process, the parameters of feature extractor and classifiersare updated alternately by consistency regularization operation and decouplingoperation to gradually improve the generalization performance of the model. Ourmethod has achieved a competitive result over the state-of-the-artsemi-supervised methods on the Atrial Segmentation Challenge dataset,demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.

'To ensure safety in automated driving, the correct perception of thesituation inside the car is as important as its environment. Thus, seatoccupancy detection and classification of detected instances play an importantrole in interior sensing. By the knowledge of the seat occupancy status, it ispossible to, e.g., automate the airbag deployment control. Furthermore, thepresence of a driver, which is necessary for partially automated driving carsat the automation levels two to four can be verified. In this work, we comparedifferent statistical methods from the field of image segmentation to approachthe problem of background-foreground segmentation in camera based interiorsensing. In the recent years, several methods based on different techniqueshave been developed and applied to images or videos from differentapplications. The peculiarity of the given scenarios of interior sensing is,that the foreground instances and the background both contain static as well asdynamic elements. In data considered in this work, even the camera position isnot completely fixed. We review and benchmark three different methods ranging,i.e., Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Morphological Snakes and a deep neuralnetwork, namely a Mask R-CNN. In particular, the limitations of the classicalmethods, GMM and Morphological Snakes, for interior sensing are shown.Furthermore, it turns, that it is possible to overcome these limitations bydeep learning, e.g.\ using a Mask R-CNN. Although only a small amount of groundtruth data was available for training, we enabled the Mask R-CNN to producehigh quality background-foreground masks via transfer learning. Moreover, wedemonstrate that certain augmentation as well as pre- and post-processingmethods further enhance the performance of the investigated methods.""High-quality training data play a key role in image segmentation tasks.Usually, pixel-level annotations are expensive, laborious and time-consumingfor the large volume of training data. To reduce labelling cost and improvesegmentation quality, interactive segmentation methods have been proposed,which provide the result with just a few clicks. However, their performancedoes not meet the requirements of practical segmentation tasks in terms ofspeed and accuracy. In this work, we propose EdgeFlow, a novel architecturethat fully utilizes interactive information of user clicks with edge-guidedflow. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without anypost-processing or iterative optimization scheme. Comprehensive experiments onbenchmarks also demonstrate the superiority of our method. In addition, withthe proposed method, we develop an efficient interactive segmentation tool forpractical data annotation tasks. The source code and tool is avaliable athttps://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleSeg.',
'Semantic segmentation of fine-resolution urban scene images plays a vitalrole in extensive practical applications, such as land cover mapping, urbanchange detection, environmental protection and economic assessment. Driven byrapid developments in deep learning technologies, convolutional neural networks(CNNs) have dominated the semantic segmentation task for many years.Convolutional neural networks adopt hierarchical feature representation andhave strong local context extraction. However, the local property of theconvolution layer limits the network from capturing global information that iscrucial for improving fine-resolution image segmentation. Recently, Transformercomprise a hot topic in the computer vision domain. Vision Transformerdemonstrates the great capability of global information modelling, boostingmany vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection andespecially semantic segmentation. In this paper, we propose an efficient hybridTransformer (EHT) for semantic segmentation of urban scene images. EHT takesadvantage of CNNs and Transformer, learning global-local context to strengthenthe feature representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EHT hashigher efficiency with competitive accuracy compared with state-of-the-artbenchmark methods. Specifically, the proposed EHT achieves a 67.0% mIoU on theUAVid test set and outperforms other lightweight models significantly. The codewill be available soon.',
'To mitigate the radiologists workload, computer-aided diagnosis with thecapability to review and analyze medical images is gradually deployed. Deeplearning-based region of interest segmentation is among the most exciting usecases. However, this paradigm is restricted in real-world clinical applicationsdue to poor robustness and generalization. The issue is more sinister with alack of training data. In this paper, we address the challenge from therepresentation learning point of view. We investigate that the collapsedrepresentations, as one of the main reasons which caused poor robustness andgeneralization, could be avoided through transfer learning. Therefore, wepropose a novel two-stage framework for robust generalized segmentation. Inparticular, an unsupervised Tile-wise AutoEncoder (T-AE) pretrainingarchitecture is coined to learn meaningful representation for improving thegeneralization and robustness of the downstream tasks. Furthermore, the learnedknowledge is transferred to the segmentation benchmark. Coupled with an imagereconstruction network, the representation keeps to be decoded, encouraging themodel to capture more semantic features. Experiments of lung segmentation onmulti chest X-ray datasets are conducted. Empirically, the related experimentalresults demonstrate the superior generalization capability of the proposedframework on unseen domains in terms of high performance and robustness tocorruption, especially under the scenario of the limited training data.""Generalising deep models to new data from new centres (termed here domains)remains a challenge. This is largely attributed to shifts in data statistics(domain shifts) between source and unseen domains. Recently, gradient-basedmeta-learning approaches where the training data are split into meta-train andmeta-test sets to simulate and handle the domain shifts during training haveshown improved generalisation performance. However, the current fullysupervised meta-learning approaches are not scalable for medical imagesegmentation, where large effort is required to create pixel-wise annotations.Meanwhile, in a low data regime, the simulated domain shifts may notapproximate the true domain shifts well across source and unseen domains. Toaddress this problem, we propose a novel semi-supervised meta-learningframework with disentanglement. We explicitly model the representations relatedto domain shifts. Disentangling the representations and combining them toreconstruct the input image allows unlabeled data to be used to betterapproximate the true domain shifts for meta-learning. Hence, the model canachieve better generalisation performance, especially when there is a limitedamount of labeled data. Experiments show that the proposed method is robust ondifferent segmentation tasks and achieves state-of-the-art generalisationperformance on two public benchmarks.',
'The success of deep learning methods in medical image segmentation tasksheavily depends on a large amount of labeled data to supervise the training. Onthe other hand, the annotation of biomedical images requires domain knowledgeand can be laborious. Recently, contrastive learning has demonstrated greatpotential in learning latent representation of images even without any label.Existing works have explored its application to biomedical image segmentationwhere only a small portion of data is labeled, through a pre-training phasebased on self-supervised contrastive learning without using any labels followedby a supervised fine-tuning phase on the labeled portion of data only. In thispaper, we establish that by including the limited label in formation in thepre-training phase, it is possible to boost the performance of contrastivelearning. We propose a supervised local contrastive loss that leverages limitedpixel-wise annotation to force pixels with the same label to gather around inthe embedding space. Such loss needs pixel-wise computation which can beexpensive for large images, and we further propose two strategies, downsamplingand block division, to address the issue. We evaluate our methods on two publicbiomedical image datasets of different modalities. With different amounts oflabeled data, our methods consistently outperform the state-of-the-artcontrast-based methods and other semi-supervised learning techniques.""Image segmentation algorithms often depend on appearance models thatcharacterize the distribution of pixel values in different image regions. Wedescribe a new approach for estimating appearance models directly from animage, without explicit consideration of the pixels that make up each region.Our approach is based on novel algebraic expressions that relate local imagestatistics to the appearance of spatially coherent regions. We describe twoalgorithms that can use the aforementioned algebraic expressions to estimateappearance models directly from an image. The first algorithm solves a systemof linear and quadratic equations using a least squares formulation. The secondalgorithm is a spectral method based on an eigenvector computation. We presentexperimental results that demonstrate the proposed methods work well inpractice and lead to effective image segmentation algorithms.',
'The CNN-based methods have achieved impressive results in medical imagesegmentation, but it failed to capture the long-range dependencies due to theinherent locality of convolution operation. Transformer-based methods arepopular in vision tasks recently because of its capacity of long-rangedependencies and get a promising performance. However, it lacks in modelinglocal context, although some works attempted to embed convolutional layer toovercome this problem and achieved some improvement, but it makes the featureinconsistent and fails to leverage the natural multi-scale features ofhierarchical transformer, which limit the performance of models. In this paper,taking medical image segmentation as an example, we present MISSFormer, aneffective and powerful Medical Image Segmentation tranSFormer. MISSFormer is ahierarchical encoder-decoder network and has two appealing designs: 1) A feedforward network is redesigned with the proposed Enhanced Transformer Block,which makes features aligned adaptively and enhances the long-rangedependencies and local context. 2) We proposed Enhanced Transformer ContextBridge, a context bridge with the enhanced transformer block to model thelong-range dependencies and local context of multi-scale features generated byour hierarchical transformer encoder. Driven by these two designs, theMISSFormer shows strong capacity to capture more valuable dependencies andcontext in medical image segmentation. The experiments on multi-organ andcardiac segmentation tasks demonstrate the superiority, effectiveness androbustness of our MISSFormer, the exprimental results of MISSFormer trainedfrom scratch even outperforms state-of-the-art methods pretrained on ImageNet,and the core designs can be generalized to other visual segmentation tasks. Thecode will be released in Github.',
'Deep learning has become in recent years a cornerstone tool fueling keyinnovations in the industry, such as autonomous driving. To attain goodperformances, the neural network architecture used for a given application mustbe chosen with care. These architectures are often handcrafted and thereforeprone to human biases and sub-optimal selection. Neural Architecture Search(NAS) is a framework introduced to mitigate such risks by jointly optimizingthe network architectures and its weights. Albeit its novelty, it was appliedon complex tasks with significant results - e.g. semantic image segmentation.In this technical paper, we aim to evaluate its ability to tackle a challengingoperational task: semantic segmentation of objects of interest in satelliteimagery. Designing a NAS framework is not trivial and has strong dependenciesto hardware constraints. We therefore motivate our NAS approach selection andprovide corresponding implementation details. We also present novel ideas tocarry out other such use-case studies.',
'Identifying the genetic variants that increase the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in humans has been a formidable challenge. Adopting a genome-wide association strategy, we genotyped 1161 Finnish T2D cases and 1174 Finnish normal glucose-tolerant (NGT) controls with >315,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and imputed genotypes for an additional >2 million autosomal SNPs. We carried out association analysis with these SNPs to identify genetic variants that predispose to T2D, compared our T2D association results with the results of two similar studies, and genotyped 80 SNPs in an additional 1215 Finnish T2D cases and 1258 Finnish NGT controls. We identify T2D-associated variants in an intergenic region of chromosome 11p12, contribute to the identification of T2D-associated variants near the genes IGF2BP2 and CDKAL1 and the region of CDKN2A and CDKN2B, and confirm that variants near TCF7L2, SLC30A8, HHEX, FTO, PPARG, and KCNJ11 are associated with T2D risk. This brings the number of T2D loci now confidently identified to at least 10.',
'Through meta-analysis of GWA data from432,000 samples, followed by additional large-scale follow-up, we have identified six new loci that show compelling associations with adult BMI. Four of these loci (TMEM18, GNPDA2, SH2B1 and NEGR1) also show compelling evidence of association with obesity in adults or children. In general, definitive identification of the specific mechanisms through which these loci influence BMI and obesity will require detailed fine mapping and subsequent functional characterization. With the exception of SH2B1, the genes most strongly implicated on the basis of colocalization with the association signal have limited prior candidacy. We compared our results with those obtained in another large GWAS of BMI, described in an accompanying manuscript by Thorleifsson et al.12. For the five of our six newly identified loci where a comparison was possible (those that had strongly correlated proxies on the Illumina 317K genotyping platform at TMEM18, KCTD15, SH2B1, MTCH2 and NEGR1), the data of Thorleifsson et al. also showed strong evidence of association (Table 1); for GNPDA2, no adequate proxy was available. None of the other top SNPs for which we attempted replication and which had adequate proxies showed evidence of associations in the study by Thorleifsson et al. (Supplementary Table 5; results provided by U. Thorsteinsdottir, G. Thorleifsson and K. Stefansson on behalf of Thorleifsson et al.). After the six validated loci (and SNPs in LD with them) were removed from our analysis, we no longer observed a clear excess of P values smaller than expected by chance (Fig. 1c). One might conclude from this that few detectable BMI loci remain to be found. However, we are encouraged in further pursuit because among the remaining data are two additional loci reported by Thorleifsson et al. (BDNF and ETV5); both of these loci show strong confirming evidence for association in our stage 1 meta-analysis (P values of 0.00035 and 0.00043).',
'Blood concentrations of lipoproteins and lipids are heritable1 risk factors for cardiovascular disease2,3. Using genome-wide association data from three studies (n = 8,816 that included 2,758 individuals from the Diabetes Genetics Initiative specific to the current paper as well as 1,874 individuals from the FUSION study of type 2 diabetes and 4,184 individuals from the SardiNIA study of aging-associated variables reported in a companion paper in this issue4) and targeted replication association analyses in up to 18,554 independent participants, we show that common SNPs at 18 loci are reproducibly associated with concentrations of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and/or triglycerides. Six of these loci are new (P < 5 × 10−8 for each new locus). Of the six newly identified chromosomal regions, two were associated with LDL cholesterol (1p13 near CELSR2, PSRC1 and SORT1 and 19p13 near CILP2 and PBX4), one with HDL cholesterol (1q42 in GALNT2) and five with triglycerides (7q11 near TBL2 and MLXIPL, 8q24 near TRIB1, 1q42 in GALNT2, 19p13 near CILP2 and PBX4 and 1p31 near ANGPTL3). At 1p13, the LDL-associated SNP was also strongly correlated with CELSR2, PSRC1, and SORT1 transcript levels in human liver, and a proxy for this SNP was recently shown to affect risk for coronary artery disease5. Understanding the molecular, cellular and clinical consequences of the newly identified loci may inform therapy and clinical care.'
'Title: Genetic Variant rs7105934 and Its Association with Susceptibility to Cardiovascular Disease: A Meta-analysisAbstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and understanding the genetic factors underlying its susceptibility is \of great significance for disease prevention and management. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the genetic variant rs7105934 and susceptibility to CVD through a comprehensive meta-analysis.\A systematic literature search was conducted in major electronic databases, and eligible studies evaluatingthe relationship between rs7105934 and CVD risk were included. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. Subgroup analyses were performed based on various CVD subtypes, including coronary artery disease, stroke, and heart failure. A total of 10 studies comprising a diverse population of participants were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled  results revealed a significant association between rs7105934 and CVD susceptibility (OR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.10-1.42, p < 0.001).  Subgroup analyses indicated a consistent association between rs7105934 and coronary artery disease (OR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.14-1.50, p < 0.001) and stroke (OR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.02-1.48, p = 0.031), while no  significant association was observed with heart failure (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.96-1.29, p = 0.161 The findings of this meta-analysis suggest that the genetic variant rs7105934 is associated with increased  susceptibility to CVD, particularly coronary artery disease and stroke. Further studies are warranted to elucidate  the functional implications of this genetic variant and its potential role in the pathogenesis of CVD. These findings may have implications for personalized medicine approaches and the development of targeted interventions for individuals at increased risk of CVD based on their genetic profile'
'Title: The Role of rs7105934 Polymorphism in Disease Susceptibility: A Review Abstract: Genetic variations have been recognized as important contributors to the development and progression of various diseases. The rs7105934 polymorphism, located in a non-coding region of the human genome, has emerged as a potential genetic marker associated with disease susceptibility. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the rs7105934 polymorphism and its implications in disease risk across different populations. Through an extensive search of the PubMed database, we identified relevant studies investigating the association between rs7105934 polymorphism and various diseases, including cardiovascular disorders, autoimmune conditions, and cancer. The literature suggests that the rs7105934 polymorphism may exert a modulating effect on gene expression and subsequent disease susceptibility. However, conflicting findings have been reported, indicating the importance of considering ethnic diversity, sample size, and study design in interpreting the results. We discuss the potential mechanisms by which rs7105934 polymorphism may influence disease susceptibility, including its impact on gene regulation, transcriptional activity, and protein function. Additionally, we highlight the limitations and challenges encountered in the studies conducted thus far, such as the need for larger and more diverse cohorts, as well as the incorporation of functional assays to elucidate the biological significance of this polymorphism. In conclusion, the rs7105934 polymorphism represents a promising genetic variant with potential implications for disease susceptibility. Further research is warranted to establish its precise role and clinical significance across different diseases and populations. Understanding the impact of this polymorphism may ultimately contribute to personalized medicine and the development of targeted therapeutic interventions.'
